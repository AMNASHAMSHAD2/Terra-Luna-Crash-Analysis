# Terra-Luna-Crash-Analysis-Findings
The results suggest:
A decreasing network density, higher centralization and higher transitivity can be a sign of an upcoming crash creating a “domino effect” 
in the network. 
The network is most centralized when Luna price reaches close to zero causing a significant fraction of transactions to be done by a 
group of users. With key players in the network coming together, the network, insider trading starts with groups of individuals. 
This panic selling results in drastic decrease in price of a coin.
Modularity of network dropped to lowest in month of May indicating high integration among nodes right during Luna crash whereas it is 
observed modularity was highest in month of April to have a possibility of crash soon
In future if the value of a USTC will increase, investors can also think about buying WLUNA to diversify their holdings and possibly 
boost returns because of high correlation. Similarly, a decrease in USTC price can account for a further decrease in Luna price.
